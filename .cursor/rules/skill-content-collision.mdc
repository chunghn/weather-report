# Skill Content Collision Handling

When multiple skills cover similar topics, follow these guidelines to determine if they complement or conflict, and how to resolve any issues.

## Detection

### Signs of Content Collision

1. **Overlapping Topics**: Multiple skills cover the same concept (e.g., memoization, compound components)
2. **Different Levels of Detail**: One skill is general, another is specific
3. **Different Scopes**: One is framework-specific, another is general
4. **Contradictory Guidance**: Skills provide conflicting recommendations

### Analysis Framework

When you encounter overlapping skills, analyze:

| Aspect          | Question                      | Example                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**       | What is the primary purpose?  | Performance optimization vs general patterns |
| **Specificity** | How detailed is the guidance? | 57 detailed rules vs general examples        |
| **Scope**       | What's the domain/context?    | Next.js-specific vs React general            |
| **Priority**    | What's the priority level?    | CRITICAL → LOW vs general best practices     |

## Resolution Strategies

### 1. Complementary Skills (No Conflict)

When skills complement each other at different levels:

**✅ Keep both skills** and document when to use each:

```markdown
**Recommendation:**

- Use `vercel-react-best-practices` for React/Next.js performance optimization tasks
- Use `frontend-patterns` for general React pattern reference
- Use `coding-standards` for general code quality
```

**Characteristics:**

- Different levels of detail (specific vs general)
- Different scopes (framework-specific vs universal)
- Different priorities (optimization-focused vs pattern-focused)
- No contradictory advice

### 2. Conflicting Guidance

When skills provide contradictory recommendations:

### Step 1: Identify the Conflict

```markdown
**Conflict:**

- Skill A recommends: "Always use render props for composition"
- Skill B recommends: "Prefer children over render props"
```

### Step 2: Determine Authority

- Check which skill has higher specificity/authority
- Check which skill is more recent or actively maintained
- Check which skill aligns with project standards

### Step 3: Resolve

- **Option A**: Update the less specific skill to reference the authoritative one
- **Option B**: Merge guidance, keeping the more nuanced recommendation
- **Option C**: Deprecate one skill if it's clearly superseded

### Example Resolution

```markdown
**Resolution:**

- `vercel-composition-patterns` provides explicit guidance: prefer children over render props
- `frontend-patterns` shows both as valid patterns
- **Action**: Use `vercel-composition-patterns` guidance when refactoring; `frontend-patterns` for general reference
```

### 3. Redundant Content

When skills duplicate content without adding value:

**Action**: Consolidate or deprecate the redundant skill

```markdown
**Redundancy Detected:**

- Skill A and Skill B both cover the same topic with identical guidance
- Skill A is more comprehensive

**Resolution:**

- Keep Skill A (more comprehensive)
- Update Skill B to reference Skill A, or deprecate Skill B
```

## Best Practices

### When Creating New Skills

1. **Check for Existing Skills**: Search `.cursor/skills/` for similar content
2. **Identify Your Niche**: What unique value does this skill provide?
3. **Document Relationships**: In skill description, mention related skills
4. **Specify Scope**: Make it clear when to use this skill vs others

### When Analyzing Collisions

1. **Read Both Skills**: Understand the full context of each
2. **Compare Examples**: Look at concrete examples to see differences
3. **Check Priority Levels**: Understand if one is more authoritative
4. **Document Findings**: Create or update `CONTENT_COLLISION_ANALYSIS.md`

### When Using Skills

1. **Use Most Specific First**: Prefer detailed, specific skills for targeted tasks
2. **Fall Back to General**: Use general skills for broader pattern reference
3. **Combine When Appropriate**: Use multiple complementary skills together
4. **Resolve Conflicts Explicitly**: If guidance conflicts, choose based on project needs

## Example: Memoization Overlap

**Skills Involved:**

- `vercel-react-best-practices`: Detailed memoization rules with anti-patterns
- `frontend-patterns`: General memoization examples
- `coding-standards`: General best practices

**Analysis:**

- ✅ No conflict - different levels of detail
- ✅ Complementary - each serves different needs

**Usage:**

```markdown
**For performance optimization:**
→ Use `vercel-react-best-practices` (detailed, prioritized rules)

**For general pattern reference:**
→ Use `frontend-patterns` (basic examples)

**For code quality:**
→ Use `coding-standards` (general best practices)
```

## Documentation

When you identify a collision:

1. **Update Analysis File**: Document in `.cursor/skills/CONTENT_COLLISION_ANALYSIS.md`
2. **Update Skill Descriptions**: Add "Related Skills" section if helpful
3. **Create Decision Guide**: If needed, create a quick reference for which skill to use

## Checklist

When handling skill collisions:

- [ ] Identified overlapping topics
- [ ] Analyzed focus, specificity, scope, and priority
- [ ] Determined if complementary or conflicting
- [ ] Documented resolution strategy
- [ ] Updated skill descriptions if needed
- [ ] Updated `CONTENT_COLLISION_ANALYSIS.md` if it exists
